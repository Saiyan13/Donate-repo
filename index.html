    <h2>Donation is an act of kindness</h2>
    <p>An act of kindness is just that  something unexpected done by one person that blesses someone else. Sometimes, these acts of kindness are done anonymously (or not). And sometimes, a person personally knows the person receiving the kindness act (and sometimes not).
        No matter what you decide to do, if you're helping someone else, you're performing an act of kindness.</p>
