             <h1> <b>Our Donate Plan </b> </h1>
            <p>We already dispatched 400,000 water purification tablets that can support 80,000 households with clean water for a week. We are working to further support the Government of Bangladesh's emergency response with millions of water purification tablets, more than 10,000 water containers known as jerry cans, and thousands of hygiene kits for women and adolescent girls. We are also procuring emergency medicines supplies for district health facilities.</p>

<p>Over 36,000 children have taken refuge in overcrowded shelters together with their families. Schools have been closed, and exams cancelled, further hampering the education of children who already suffered an 18-months of pandemic school closure.

 <p>Our heart goes out for the children whose lives have been lost. Children are the most vulnerable in this desperate situation. UNICEF is working around the clock with authorities and our partners to meet the immediate needs of children.
